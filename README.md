# REALITY Framework Lead Magnet Mini-Sites

This project contains a collection of worksheet-based lead magnets designed around the REALITY Architecture Framework. Each worksheet lives in its own folder and can be deployed as an independent mini-site on Vercel.

## Project Structure

Each lead magnet is organized in its own folder containing:
- An HTML worksheet page with embedded styling
- Clean, printable design optimized for PDF export
- Interactive elements for digital completion

## The REALITY Architecture Framework

**R — Resonance (Identity ignition)**  
Who are you, really?  
The internal frequency of truth. Soul-level clarity. Your origin signal.

**E — Expertise (Embodied brand)**  
What are you undeniably great at?  
Refined skills + lived experience = personal brand with weight.

**A — Alignment (Audience fit)**  
Who are you here to serve?  
Syncing your signal to those ready to receive it. Message–market resonance.

**L — Launch (Offer or App)**  
What reality are you building?  
The manifestation point. Your system, service, or product enters the world.

**I — Iteration (Feedback alchemy)**  
Where are the gaps?  
Learn, adapt, refine. Reality bends through data-informed evolution.

**T — Testing (Proof of reality)**  
Can it hold under pressure?  
Systematic validation of what you've built — emotionally, technically, financially.

**Y — Yield (Sustainable growth)**  
What does it produce now?  
Momentum, revenue, community, leverage. Your reality becomes regenerative.

## Deployment
